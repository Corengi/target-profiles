Developing new treatments for diseases depends on clinical research studies, but studies often struggle to recruit patients. According to Centerwatch, 94% of people recognize the importance of participating in clinical research in order to assist in the advancement of medical science. Yet 75% of the general public state they have little to no knowledge about the clinical research enterprise and the participation process. As a consequence, almost half of all trials never reach their recruitment targets. To address this problem Lilly, Novartis, and Pfizer, are partnering in the US to provide a new platform to improve access to information about clinical trials for patients and providers. At the heart of the project is the goal is to enable patients to find, understand and “match” to clinical studies that meet their needs.
